	<h2>Damscus Steel</h2><br>

        <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>Damascus steel was the forged steel of the blades of swords smithed in the Near East from ingots of Wootz steel[1] imported from Southern India and Sri Lanka. This was known as Sinhala Wane (Sinhala Steeel) These swords are characterized by distinctive patterns of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water, or in a "ladder" or "teardrop" pattern. Such blades were reputed to be tough, resistant to shattering, and capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge.[2]</p>

        <p>The steel is named after Damascus, the capital city of Syria and one of the largest cities in the ancient Levant. It may either refer to swords made or sold in Damascus directly, or it may just refer to the aspect of the typical patterns, by comparison with Damask fabrics (also named for Damascus).[3][4]

        </p>	
        <p>The original method of producing Wootz steel in Sri Lanka used advance use of natural wind[5]. Large areas of ruined steel production facilities are found in Kalthota, thanna, kubalgama, aluthnuwara, Nadungama, Kosgama, hatan pola & Balangoda of Sri Lanka. Modern attempts to duplicate the metal have not been entirely successful due to differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques. Several individuals in modern times have claimed that they have rediscovered the methods by which the original Damascus steel was produced.[6][7][8]

        </p>

        <p>The reputation and history of Damascus steel has given rise to many legends, such as the ability to cut through a rifle barrel or to cut a hair falling across the blade.[9] A research team in Germany published a report in 2006 revealing nanowires and carbon nanotubes in a blade forged from Damascus steel.[10][11][12] Although many types of modern steel outperform ancient Damascus alloys, chemical reactions in the production process made the blades extraordinary for their time, as Damascus steel was superplastic and very hard at the same time. During the smelting process to obtain Wootz steel ingots, woody biomass and leaves are known to have been used as carburizing additives along with certain specific types of iron rich in microalloying elements. These ingots would then be further forged and worked into Damascus steel blades. Research now shows that carbon nanotubes can be derived from plant fibers,[13] suggesting how the nanotubes were formed in the steel. Some experts expect to discover such nanotubes in more relics as they are analyzed more closely.[11]
